    "name": "Wesāl",
    "artist": "Karim Abd Elmalak",
    "date": "January 4 - 28, 2025",
    "overview": "Karim Abd Elmalak, with pride of place amongst Safarkhan’s core family of resident artists, and ever the meticulous innovating talent, has been devotedly consumed within his laborious creative process over the past couple of years, for Safarkhan to unveil his latest collection which will be exhibiting from Saturday 4 to Tuesday 28 January, 2025. As we embark upon the new year’s uncharted path, Abd Elmalak’s sensuous and enrapturing canvases take on a decidedly new direction, and aptly reflect both the temporal stage and the abstract notion of renewal, as he presents without any doubt the most accomplished work yet seen from his insatiable artistic spirit. Wesāl explores Abd Elmalak’s fascination with the phenomena of bonding in its distinct iterations and delves into this profound concept through an irresistible compositional trifecta; the fusion of letter, thread and pigment in a thought-provoking yet supremely pacifying synergistic triumph.This compositional triage is recurrent in the three forms that the artist’s concept of wesāl exists in. First is the bonding of the self, this is the intrapersonal quest of self-discovery, coming to terms with and eventually overcoming one’s own ego. Secondly, is the bonding between people, these are the interpersonal relationships that we cherish, the bonds of love that inseparably intertwine families, friends and spouses. Lastly, it is the primacy of spiritual bonding that we all aspire to, the heavenly bond we seek to nurture with God, where ascension to a higher plain sees our immortal souls transcend our ephemeral flesh. With each compositional aspect embodying the intrinsic message of bonding, Abd Elmalak assiduously gathers disparate modes of human expression into a philosophical and harmonizing unity. The artist does not confine such aspects to the background however, as they fittingly become one with or bound to the human figures they are superimposed over, resulting in a striking tapestry of emotive aura.Excerpts of the artist’s most beloved and studiously curated classical Arabic poetry, in its whimsical stylized calligraphic form, emphasize the concept of bonding not only in their potent literary connotations, but aesthetically through the elegant physical connection of each letter to another, elemental to the Arabic language with its characteristic enjoining script. Imprints of textile artistry in the form of handwoven oriental carpets establish patchwork assemblages alongside the poetic verses. Typically, patterns of oriental rugs contain their own inherent symbology pertaining to their region of origin, but through their incorporation, Abd Elmalak subtly conveys an overarching message. The countless number of threads bound to one another in any carpet are symbolic of the power of bonding in its exponential potential, where millions of otherwise tiny threads connect with one another to form something greater and enduring. It is a metaphorical representation of the threads of fate that bind us to one another and to those we love. As much like these inanimate letters and threads written and woven together, the painted protagonists that animate Abd Elmalak’s art personify this synergetic property where the coming together or wesāl (bonding) – of the self, between persons, or with the higher power – is arguably the most sincere manifestation of love imaginable.",
